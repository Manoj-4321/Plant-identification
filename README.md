# Plant-identification
I developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for sorting and identifying Vidanga plant species based on fruit images. This model utilizes machine learning techniques to distinguish and classify different Vidanga species accurately, contributing to efficient plant species identification and research in the field of botany.
